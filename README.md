# Unasked

**Your meetings, understood.**

Unasked is an AI-powered assistant that captures what matters while you lead the conversation. Never lose track of decisions, action items, or open questions again.

## What it does

- **Live Transcription** — Every word captured as it's spoken, in English and French
- **Decisions & Actions** — Instantly see who committed to what, with deadlines, sorted by priority
- **Spot the Blockers** — Get alerted when discussions go in circles or when people contradict each other
- **Open Questions** — Never forget a question that was raised but never answered
- **One-Click Export** — Copy your meeting notes and share with your team instantly

## Privacy First

Audio is processed locally and sent directly to APIs. No recordings stored. Your conversations stay private.
